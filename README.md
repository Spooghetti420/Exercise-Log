# Exercise Log
This is a tracker for all my calisthenics exercise reps.
I'm currently following in the credo of *Convict Conditioning* by Paul Wade, which is a lifelong
calisthenics guide with progressively-intensifying exercises for each important bodily faculty:
we have push-ups for the chest and triceps, pull-ups for the biceps and healing the spine,
squats for developing steel-girder legs, leg raises for a "midsection from hell" (I love Wade's descriptions!),
and bridging for straightening the posture and maintaining flexibility. Or, at least, that's the ideal.
*As I currently write, I'm nowhere near the end goals of the programme, and am still in the early stages.*
The handstand push-up is the most extreme exercise in the series, culminating in a one-handed upside-down
push-up leant against a wall, repeating the motion 100 times or more. Truly the peak of physical attainment!
So I've decided to progress along the series while counting my reps for each tier.
I don't know how many I've done already, and I've done tiny amounts of exercise over a long while
before starting this journal, so I figured I should start from zero and get counting!
